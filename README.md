Heteroscedasticity is a statistical concept that refers to the situation where the variance of a dependent variable changes across different levels of an independent variable. 
In other words, the spread or dispersion of the data points varies significantly at different points in the data.
This can be a problem in statistical modeling, as many statistical tests and models assume homoscedasticity (constant variance) and may not be reliable if the data is heteroscedastic. 
Techniques such as weighted least squares regression and robust standard error estimation can help to address heteroscedasticity in data analysis.
